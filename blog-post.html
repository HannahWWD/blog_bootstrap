                <h4>1.Introduction</h4>
                <p class="text-justify">This paper will examine Google Calendar, a widely used time management and schedule tracking
                    tool,through the lens of a combination of two theories - <i>Distributed Cognition</i> [1] and
                    <i>Sociomateriality[2]</i>. <strong> Calendar here is considered specifically in the organization
                        context, the role of which is a work calendar in this case</strong>. In a macro point of view,
                    Google Calendar, as a work calendar, is a digital platform whose content is dynamically constituted
                    by the ongoing social events, culture, and norms within a company. <em>However, Google Calendar
                        cannot make responses to these social factors without human’s manual intervention</em>. Breaking
                    down, these interventions are implemented through the process of cognition distribution, including
                    the <u>delegation from mind to object, and cognition exchanging between people</u>, which is also
                    the fundamental mechanism that enables the “share calendar” feature. In the following sections I
                    will start by briefly introducing the technology and related theories. In Section 2 I will discuss
                    why choosing the combination of Distributed Cognition and Sociomateriality could bring new
                    understandings to this technology. In Section 3, I will unpack new understandings of Google Calendar
                    through the combined lens in detail. In Section 4, I will discuss the design opportunities and
                    implications for the other HCI problems revealed by this combined perspective.

                <h4>2.Theories in nutshells</h4>
                <h5>2.1 Google calendar</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">Google Calendar is a material platform that helps us “remember” important tasks, as well as organize
                    our schedule
                    by adding and modifying events [3]. Google Calendar could be shared with permission, which means
                    that users
                    could get access to others’ calendars [3]. Some of the companies leverage this shared feature in
                    Google
                    Calendars to keep track with their employees’ work schedules as one of the measurements of their
                    performance.
                </p>
                <h5>2.2 Sociomateriality </h5>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>Sociomateriality is a theory built upon the intersection of technology, work, and organization
                        [4]</b>. Wanda
                    Orlikowski, the pioneer in sociomaterial theory, argues that social and material are not separated.
                </p>
                <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociomateriality">
                    <p>“social and the material are constitutively entangled in everyday organizational life” [2].</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-justify"> Here, “constitutively” means the ability to establish the form, such as using bricks to constitute a
                    house [5].
                    “Entangled” means that two things are so infused that it is impossible to experience them as
                    separate entities
                    [2][5]. Further, Sociomateriality posits that social and material are not just constantly shaping
                    each other,
                    but also constructing each other. All materiality is social in that it was created and used through
                    social
                    processes and social contexts and that all social action is possible because of some materiality
                    [6]. One
                    example of sociomateriality, mentioned by Orlikowski, is the Google Search. Google Search is not a
                    static
                    material, instead, the results it presents are dynamic and constituted by a list of social factors,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the authenticity of the website (official website first)</li>
                    <li>interactions by other users</li>
                    <li>the relativity to the search term</li>
                    <li>the interventions by government</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-justify"><u>Vice versa, the social action of clicking the most related result</u>, which is most likely on
                    top, relies on
                    the order generated by the PageRank algorithm [2].</p>
